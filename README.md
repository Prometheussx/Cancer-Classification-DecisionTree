## About the Project

Breast cancer is a critical health issue, and early diagnosis is crucial. In this project, we tackle breast cancer classification using machine learning techniques, particularly decision tree algorithms. This repository provides all the resources you need to understand, implement, and evaluate a decision tree model for breast cancer classification.

## Data Description

We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features are used to classify the mass as benign (B) or malignant (M).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Prometheussx/breast-cancer-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook BreastCancerClassification.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the decision tree algorithm for breast cancer classification. You can also experiment with different parameters, visualize the results, and gain insights into how machine learning models work.

## Results

Our decision tree model achieved an accuracy rate of 90.6% in classifying breast cancer tumors. You can explore the model's performance in the Jupyter Notebook and see how different features impact the classification.
